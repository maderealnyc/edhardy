MAKE SURE TO READ BELOW BEFORE GETTING STARTED FOR THE FIRST TIME!

You may be thinking…

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA…WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

But before you freak out, let me take a few minutes to explain.

Bones now uses LESS or Sass by default. If you prefer
using regular CSS, then feel free to modify this theme how you like
and keep a copy as your own personal starting point.

DON'T DISMISS IT JUST YET THOUGH, USING LESS or Sass ISN'T AS
COMPLICATED AS YOU THINK.

It does take a few minutes to wrap your head around, but it will all
be worth it. Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you are going to be working with
LESS or Sass, that you work locally. Sass isn't readable by a browser
and using a LESS js file to parse it on live sites can make your site sluggish.

That being said, here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with a
pre-processor: (You really only need one of them)

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)

LESS App:

Compass App: (Windows / Mac Users)

SimpLESS: (Windows Users)

WinLESS: (Windows Users)

These applications compile LESS or Sass into valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production files easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.
